Curating visual documentation for justice, human rights and journalism.

**The Sudanese Archive** is a collective of human rights organizations, independent media, and engaged citizens working in Sudan to monitor and curate visual documentation related to the Sudanâ€™s uprising and other historic events. We work together to monitor and document all protests, human rights abuses and newsworthy developments, while archiving this historical footage for the future.

The Sudanese Archive gathers visual documentation from open source and primary media sources. We verify and structure this data so it can be analysed and used for reporting, advocacy and accountability purposes. We publish incident reports and are working to create a searchable database.
