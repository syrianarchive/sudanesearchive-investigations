Our mission is to document all protests, monitor human rights abuses and report on newsworthy developments, while also archiving important and historical footage for the future. 

Since December 2018, the Sudanese Archive has been documenting the historic changes in Sudan using a mix of open source and primary media. The Sudanese Archive project has a dual focus: 1) Document acts of protests and strategic developments; 2) Monitor human rights abuses and government and militia reactions actions against civilians.

Simultaneously, we are developing a database platform to make this process more efficient and secure for this project and other human rights and media organizations in Sudan.
