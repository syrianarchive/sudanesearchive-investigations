The Sudanese Archive has logged reports and media files of protests in 28 cities across Sudan on June 30. The investigation team was able to verify media portraying violence in six of those cities: Al Fashir, Al Qadarif, Atbara, Khartoum, Khartoum North (Al-Kahrtoum Bahry), and Omdurman. The Sudanese Archive also gathered media purported to depict violence in two other cities - El Obeid and Kassala - remaining to be verified. In two additional cities, Kosti and Port Sudan, there are reports of violence from credible sources on the ground, although our investigative team has not yet obtained media depicting those reports that can be verified.

# Gathering data and media of protests held

The Sudanese Archive has collected thousands of videos indicating protests and subsequent violence by monitoring social media and working with contacts in Sudan to archive material, as well as identifying credible sources regularly posting content. The Archive monitoring team also incorporates public statements from credible associations and political figures in the database.

# Verifying the media files

The Sudanese Archive collaborates with the Syrian Archive and the Berkeley Human Rights Center for support with verification.
Each verified video went through basic geolocation to ensure it was shot in Sudan. The Sudanese Archive has also identified the city and location coordinates. This was done by comparing reference points (e.g. buildings, signposts, mountains ranges) with Google Earth satellite imagery.
The Sudanese Archive also verified the date the media was posted and likely date of its filming, by cross referencing the publishing date on social media platforms (ex. Twitter and Facebook) with dates from reports concerning the same incident and research of the shadows in the videos.
The Syrian Archive also works with local journalists, human rights activists, and staff of medical facilities.  The Archive investigation team also cross-references the data with that of credible associations and media agencies.

# Submitting videos

In order to provide the most complete and accurate information, we are always looking for new evidence to collect and add to our database. If you would like to send us a video which is not already in our data, please reach us at info@sudanesearchive.org.

# Errors and corrections

We strive for accuracy and transparency of process in our reporting and presentation. That said, we do recognise that the information publicly available for particular events can at times be limited. Our video datasets are therefore organically maintained, and represent our best present understanding of alleged incidents.

If you have new information about a particular event; if you find an error in our work - or if you have concerns about the way we are reporting our data - please do engage with us. You can reach us at info@sudanesearchive.org.
