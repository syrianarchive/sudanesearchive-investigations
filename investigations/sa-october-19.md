Sudanese Archive has also preserved 54,955 Tweets.

Some of this content includes documentation of human rights violations. It is securely preserved by Sudanese Archive and available upon request.

Social media platforms have become accidental archives, but takedowns have proven they are no place for long-term, safe storage of materials depicting human rights violations. Alternate strategies must be used to archive this material, and Syrian Archive seeks to fill this gap.

Get in touch if you or your media organisation has been affected by content takedowns on YouTube or other social media platforms or need assistance in securely archiving documentation materials.
