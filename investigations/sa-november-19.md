Sudanese Archive preserves content from 41 YouTube channels on a daily basis. Of this, 2 YouTube channels have been made unavailable as of November 2019 but are preserved in Sudanese Archive infrastructure. 

Social media platforms have become accidental archives, but takedowns have proven they are no place for long-term, safe storage of materials depicting human rights violations. Alternate strategies must be used to archive this material, and Syrian Archive seeks to fill this gap.

Get in touch if you or your media organisation has been affected by content takedowns on YouTube or other social media platforms or need assistance in securely archiving documentation materials.
