This is an investigation produced by the Sudanese Archive in collaboration with the Berkeley Human Rights Investigation Lab. It uses open-source tools and techniques to verify evidence gathered from videos, images, and/or reports published online. The focus of this report is about violence against protesters in Khartoum’s twin city of Omdurman on June 30, 2019.

## Introduction

Protests in Sudan have continued for months as people fight for a civilian-led government. They have claimed the lives of [hundreds](https://twitter.com/Sd_Doctors/status/1151962023149936642). In April, after months of protests and a large-scale sit-in held outside the military headquarters, former president Omar Al-Bashir was ousted from power. In his place, a military-led transitional council has taken power. Protesters continued their sit-ins and marches, calling for a civilian-led transitional government. During this period, the leaders of the protests engaged in lengthy negotiations to reach an agreement with the Transitional Military Council (TMC). Talks broke down on May 15, 2019.

On June 3, 2019, the paramilitary Rapid Support Forces  [(RSF](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/06/sudan-rsf-commander-hemeti-190605223433929.html) and other security forces used violence to  [break up](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dR56qxM4kHA) the sit-in and other marches. The attack left more than [100dead, according to the Central Committee of Sudan Doctors (CCSD)](https://www.facebook.com/Sudandoctorscommittee/posts/2340095049609731?__xts__[0]=68.ARCsl9kotyk8jHIvxFuULqOSruWrVAmUW5IqCLiBbPmsVgRSMwNGHbdkHIRhlnQsKAH8G8uAXAlp2imwrCjaI8wROELkWx1EHGNH2KEucWf-0lSK3iKsA1JwAR_jSdj03xXOjDQs5WBk0YUU1w0gNXjhBvuKVvBic551LcoOh5rXQlWfm5ao7lguH9paYqB_0Hr_hJEd7fn_vLfsUyLBrKvKjIiBZ7HeaLkwhsKf9y5ytZdYBblSUlU8c1nfM2qVE740jYXunBnkJHcgU1TB6ZQH2uBxAdVZ-zbcpFdXSrGdFP-QIbrDaXNHfkTBbmF8YyCltYOhHqJZNj0K-Fvp1s3m&__tn__=-R) and dozens are still missing. Following this attack, the Sudanese Professionals Association (SPA), a key organizing group of the protests, and activists tried to regroup and plan a response.

According to [Netblocks](https://netblocks.org/reports/sudan-internet-recovery-after-month-long-shutdown-98aZpOAo), mobile connectivity was severely interrupted following June 3rd. In a press conference, the TMC [spokesperson](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3EBN-AMwhFo) admitted that the council ordered the internet block for security reasons. The internet block hindered communication between the SPA and the general public. Furthermore, it disrupted the SPA connection with neighborhood committee leaders and activists. This increased a general sense of fear, as the news was not circulating as easily as previously.

Over the next three weeks, the  SPA worked toward restoring demonstrations and reorganizing activists on the ground with the help of [grassroots resistance committees](https://www.aljazeera.com/news/2019/05/sudan-neighbourhoods-mobilised-al-bashir-190506182950504.html) through what they called the “[Revolutionary Escalation Schedule](https://www.sudaneseprofessionals.org/en/fdfc-revolutionary-escalation-schedule/)”. Their efforts included announcing night demonstration schedules and conducting awareness sessions in neighborhoods and villages across Sudan.

SPA tweets detailing the “Revolutionary Escalation Schedule”

As organizers called for more protests, there were [reports](https://www.amnestyusa.org/press-releases/sudan-remove-rapid-support-forces-from-khartoum-streets-immediately/) that the RSF was targeting civilians, mainly activists, through arrests and violence. Mohammed Naji al-Asam, an SPA leader, said in an NPR interview on June 14, 2019, that the organizers feared for their lives and those of other activists. He said that they had received threats of harm or assassination through multiple channels. The detailed interview can be found [here](https://www.npr.org/2019/06/14/732628152/sudanese-opposition-leader-speaks-out-amid-threats).

Night protests and SPA public meetings, along with a general feeling of frustration toward what happened on June 3rd, led to increasing calls for a large march on June 30 - the day that the Al-Bashir coup took place 30 years ago.

## What Happened?

On June 30 2019, protesters assembled across Sudan. Twenty-eight cities across Sudan witnessed major [protests](https://www.sudanesearchive.org/en/investigations/june30mapping.html). Our investigation team verified [reports](https://www.sudanesearchive.org/en/investigations/june30mapping.html) of violence in 9 major cities.  The CCSD put the total death toll at  eight, in addition to more than 148 injuries.

The city of [Omdurman](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Omdurman,+Sudan/@15.6424713,32.315402,11z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m5!3m4!1s0x168e8bf303b5ade3:0xffa2d3531b1ae48f!8m2!3d15.6475782!4d32.4806894), one of the three cities compromising Khartoum the capital, sits across the river from Khartoum, about 8 kilometers from where the sit-in was held. It witnessed a number of major protests since the start of the uprising in December 2018. Districts such as [Ombada](https://goo.gl/maps/mchVjCwooTP4k8Et7) [Al- Abasiya](https://goo.gl/maps/A1yVTXxRCEoWCKnH6), [Abu-Rof](https://goo.gl/maps/no5qXwus8qvRgrmJ8), [Wad-Nubawi](https://goo.gl/maps/5mcFUeNHmoZf5cGj6), and [Al-Muhandseen](https://goo.gl/maps/hpoSbLCd7BUs3qHu5) were particularly the scene of large assembly of crowds calling for regime change.

Marches across the city however were met with severe level of repression. This includes an [incident](http://www.sudantribune.com/spip.php?article66899) in which government security forces attacked medical staff and injured protesters inside Omdurman’s main hospital on 9 January, 2019. In the same month of [January](https://www.dabangasudan.org/en/all-news/article/unprecedented-march-in-omdurman-despite-live-bullets-and-tear-gas), thousands gathered to march towards the national parliament in Omdurman demanding the former president Al-Bashier step down. The rally turned out to be a turning point in the popular uprising. Since then, anti-government rallies gained momentum leading up to June 30 when a huge number of protesters started marching across the city to demand civilian rule. In Omdurman, the [CCSD reported that at least four people were killed](https://www.facebook.com/Sudandoctorscommittee/photos/a.1775635796055662/2358543364431566/?type=3&theater), and more than 50 injured, primarily from gunfire.

###The ‘One million’ March

According to the schedule posted by SPA a few days before, protestors in different cities in Sudan were to gather at specific points at 13:00, and march to the homes of some selected victims who were killed during the revolution. One of the aims of the protest, called the ‘One Million March,’ was to pay tribute in their memories and support their grieving families. The SPA announced a [plan](https://www.facebook.com/SdnProAssociation/posts/2812341875459148) specifying venues of assembly and routes leading to four major areas of the greater capital Khartoum ([Khartoum](https://goo.gl/maps/JBx4UfkjZXFjrjEC7), [Bahry](https://goo.gl/maps/qBoQs3xpb4ci4ydX9), [Omdurman](https://goo.gl/maps/YBGn899Ucvhu6N4aA) and [Sharq-Al Neel](https://goo.gl/maps/XsGvznFVxKRAh5VR6)). As for Omdurman, five assembly points and routes were identified for protesters, according to the following [post](https://www.facebook.com/SdnProAssociation/posts/2812292685464067?__tn__=K-R).

![](/assets/investigations/omdurman/image3.jpg)

Instead of visiting victims’ homes as announced in the original plan, protesters from these points and other locations in Khartoum instead moved towards the [Presidential Palace](https://goo.gl/maps/18hV2hQwUNJiERBq8), a destination of earlier marches during the course of the uprising. Protesters in Omdurman meanwhile, marched  toward the White Nile Bridge, which leads to the other part of the capital Khartoum where the Presidential Palace is located. Below is the geolocation.

One  [video](https://www.facebook.com/muntasir.abdelbagi/videos/pcb.2553484961330925/2553482327997855/?type=3&theater)  shows protesters marching along  [Al Morada Street](https://goo.gl/maps/3tyth3SuXsdSnQgh8), between the Palace of Youth and Culture and the National Parliament of Sudan, at the edge of the White Nile bridge. It was posted at 7:47 PM Sudan time on June 30.

As protesters approached the White Nile Bridge, they were blocked from crossing. Another [video](https://www.facebook.com/m7moudko/videos/2521326007928769/) posted July 1, of the same intersection and view of the bridge, shows protesters marching toward the bridge and clustering at the entrance.

![](/assets/investigations/omdurman/image7.jpg)

Markers identified in a screenshot of a verified video match the location of the ‘One Million March’ in Omdurman on June 30.

Around 6 minutes into the video, three green vehicles and two white pick-up trucks drive forward through the crowds toward the bridge. Within less than a minute, the sound of tear gas canisters launching or gunfire can be heard in the video. Another green vehicle drives forward as the protesters begin to disperse, with many running away from the crowd in different directions. By 7:30 in the video, protesters are flooding away from the bridge. By 9 minutes into the video, protesters have been cleared from the bridge, and the sounds of tear gas and gunfire continue. Protesters carry away one injured person. By about 10 minutes into the video, there are no more sounds of tear gas or gunfire, and protesters mill about the area while at least 12 more vehicles drive toward the bridge. A few more people appearing to be injured are helped away in the direction of the military hospital.

An analysis of shadows in this video by the Sudanese Archive using the [shadow calculator tool](http://suncalc.net/#/51.508,-0.125,2/2019.08.07/18:14) indicates that the video was likely taken around 3:30 p.m., and the weather matches that of June 30.

This video also corresponds to other accounts of the timeline of protests and violence in Omdurman on June 30, including those reported in this [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GlvB2Y7Y06o&feature=youtu.be) . That video shows that around 2 PM, RSF vehicles drove along Al [Arbaeen Street](https://goo.gl/maps/zHiRwMx5BbzoAYHf7) around 2:50 PM the march reached the end of Al [Morada Street](https://goo.gl/maps/iKLVSHerzFN61SMWA) where it was blocked by RSF, and at 3:30 PM protesters reached the bridge but were blocked from crossing by RSF. The video says protesters stood there for about 15 minutes before it shows a video clip of protesters fleeing amid sounds of tear gas and gunfire.

Another [video](https://www.facebook.com/abdalgader.abdall/videos/2897595783798199/)  shot from directly alongside White Nile Bridge shows protesters fleeing amid the sounds of gunfire, taking shelter behind trees and jumping over fences to get off the road.

Additional videos and photos posted online also showed armed RSF officers on top of the Palace of Youth and Children (PYC). During a news conference, the deputy head of the TMC Muhammad Hamdan Daglu, also known as Hemedti, said that there were snipers on the rooftop of the PYC and that three RSF members, as well as about five or six civilians were shot. He said the shooting was taking place as he was addressing a [public](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=WuUeEwFDcyc&t=216s&fbclid=IwAR1eViMKocEqs6BjqzqChkAOmTSMaIS2uU92Hk53C99mA_fB7kADDN7wses) gathering at Sharq al-Neel district in eastern Khartoum. The video of his comments was uploaded on June 30 at 4:35 PM according to an Amnesty International video verification tool.

## When did it happen?

Social media posts, news networks and activist pages started reporting the protests on June 30 around 1 pm.  [Reports](https://www.facebook.com/abdalgader.abdall/videos/2897595783798199/) of violence in Omdurman began surfacing around 3:30 pm as protesters attempted to cross the White Nile bridge.

To verify the time and location of the published videos and images, Sudanese Archive conducted an analysis of the weather and shadows in identified media. The weather search was conducted using the [WolframAlpha tool](https://www.wolframalpha.com/) for weather patterns on June 30, 2019. The weather specified by the tool is consistent with the weather in videos and photos posted via social media related to the incident, reinforcing what has been reported. Below is a screenshot of the WolframAlpha analysis:

## Deaths and injuries caused during the violence

### A: First reports

The first [field update](https://www.facebook.com/Sudandoctorscommittee/posts/2358594017759834) from the CCSD stated the following about the attacks in the city of Omdurman

“\- An injury with a gunshot in the head. Unstable condition admitted in ICU.

\- Three (3) cases with a gunshot in the abdomen wounds and a case with head injury with tear gas canister are undergoing surgeries at the time of this report.

\- Forty (40) wounded at El Selah El Tabi hospital, some of them are critical and required urgent surgical intervention.”

This was soon followed by a [statement](https://www.facebook.com/sudandoctorunion/posts/2833597293348748) from Sudan’s Doctors Syndicate which revealed that four civilians were shot dead in Omdurman. This was corroborated by a [report](https://www.facebook.com/Sudandoctorscommittee/posts/2358543674431535) simultaneously released by the CCSD which named the following

1- Dr. Mamoun Bashir El Tayeb. A 50 year old optometrist seen in this [picture](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=2446091285456337&id=579251728806978) who was shot outside the Military Hospital as he went there to donate blood and was shot as he was leaving.

2- Mohammed Osman Issac. A 19 year old man seen in this [picture](https://www.facebook.com/karar.osman.9/posts/1299834200186187) who lived in Al Salha, Omdurman, was shot in the neck nearby White Nile bridge and was taken to Military Hospital where he died [post](https://www.facebook.com/permalink.php?story_fbid=1469547353249304&id=100005821605344).

3- Daffa’ Allah El Daw. A young man in his twenties who worked at the cafeteria in the Sudan University for Science and Technology [pictured](https://www.facebook.com/sotalsora2019/posts/472369980013565) here.

4- A young unidentified male

On the other hand and according to the statement linked above by the Sudan’s Doctors Syndicate identified another young man named

5- Abdelraheem, 18 from Ombada, Jamous Stop and that he was shot twice in the hand and thigh and that he died as a result of his injury.

This has not been corroborated by any other entity/ body.

However, the two reports from both Sudan Doctors Syndicate and the CCSD noted a body of an unidentified young male.

### B: Khor Abu Anga Victims

Three bodies had been found next to Khor (creek) Abu Anga [map](https://www.google.com/maps/place/%D8%AE%D9%88%D8%B1+%D8%A7%D8%A8%D9%88+%D8%B9%D9%86%D8%AC%D8%A9%E2%80%AD/@15.6503381,32.4485654,16z/data=!4m5!3m4!1s0x168e8c70de091ab5:0xfb5f65d87d397f3c!8m2!3d15.64976!4d32.4536723) in the city of Omdurman in the early hours of July/1st, a day after the June 30th protests. According to the initial [report](https://www.facebook.com/Sudandoctorscommittee/posts/2359116494374253) by the Central Committee of Sudan Doctors ( CCSD), the bodies were taken to Omdurman Hospital Morgue and two of the victims were identified and all three show signs of torure and gunshot wounds. Initial posts by the CCSD did not explicitly link the bodies to the protest. We contacted Dr. Nazim Sirag of the CCSD and he confirmed that the three bodies found indeed were of protesters of the 30th June March.

1- Mohammed Abdelrahman Adam, 19 years old from the neighborhood of Al Jumueia

2- Hamid Omer Yousif , 23 years old from Dar Al Salam, Omdurman

3- Unidentified young man.

In this [video](https://www.facebook.com/omer.mahmoud.z/videos/10156929502332631/) posted to Facebook, shows a crowd of people surrounding the three bodies and videotaping their faces, two of whom were later identified as Moahmmed and Hamid. In these [picture](https://www.facebook.com/militarycouncilviolations/photos/a.618432778625201/638913496577129/?type=3)  [picture](https://www.facebook.com/militarycouncilviolations/photos/a.618432778625201/638913463243799/?type=3), the body of Mohammed Abdelrahman Adam can be clearly identified with a large wound on his jaw. According to journalist’s Shamael El Nour [post](https://www.facebook.com/shamael.elnoor/posts/10161724474830315) the autopsy report indicated “ The neck bones are damaged and so are the veins and arteries of the neck, and severe bleeding that is caused by gunshot wounds ( 3 gunshots)” In an [interview](https://www.facebook.com/mohamad.nor.5661/posts/2479572938761446) by Al Sudani newspaper with Mohammed’s family corrobaorated that their son’s body showed signed of severe torture and that he was shot from close up on the neck.

The second victim, Hamid Omar Yosif body seen in this [picture](https://www.facebook.com/militarycouncilviolations/photos/a.618432778625201/638913526577126/?type=3) was found shot in the thigh and that the forensic report concluded that he bled to death, according to a [statement](https://www.facebook.com/mohamad.nor.5661/posts/2479572938761446) by his mother to Al Sudani newspaper. Hamid’s mother added that he left in the morning of June 30th to join the protests and never came back until she received a phone call the next morning as she was searching for him informing her that he is at the Military Hospital but when she arrived she was told he is at Omdurman Hospital. Hamid Omar is 23 years old who lived in Dar Al Salam in Omdurman and was studying at the Technical School.

The third victim shown in the same video linked above and in [picture](https://www.facebook.com/militarycouncilviolations/photos/a.618432778625201/638913379910474/?type=3)  [picture](https://www.facebook.com/militarycouncilviolations/photos/a.618432778625201/638913286577150/?type=3) whom identity still remains unknown, seems to have suffered from a gunshot wound to the head.

According to a different [report](https://www.facebook.com/sudandoctorunion/posts/2836028939772250) by the Sudan Doctors’ Syndicate, pointed out that the three murdered protesters were targeted as leaders of protests because Sudanese flags, microphones and a large banner [pictured](https://www.facebook.com/wgdcom/posts/2477676022283112) here that called for the million march and justice were found next to their bodies

### C: The Story of Zaki Magdi Zaki:

Zaki a 25 year old man left his home on June 30th to participate in the million march in the city of Omdurman. His body was found twelve days later on July/12th in the morgue of Omdurman Hospital as he suffered a gunshot wound to the head on June/30th, according to a [report](https://www.facebook.com/Sudandoctorscommittee/posts/2372888709663698) by the CCSD. This report also expressed apologies by CCSD as it stated “ CCSD’s field office provided the information in time. However, administrative circumstances hindered the publication at the time.” According to the family of Zaki in an [interview](https://www.facebook.com/sotalsora2019/posts/473441806573049) with Al Sudani newspaper, pointed that they searched for him at police stations, hospitals, morgues for days..but he was never found. As internet services were restored in Sudan, videos started to surface, one of these videos is a [video](https://www.facebook.com/yahya.Huseein/videos/2431871950182455/) that was filmed on June 30th of young man in a yellow shirt being carried by protestors as he bleeds from a wound on his head. According to Zaki’s brother in the family [interview](https://www.facebook.com/sotalsora2019/posts/473441806573049) , that they saw the video and believed that the person being carried is Zaki. The video along with screenshots were posted to a Facebook group named MISSING ( a group that features info and pictures of those missing during the revolution) as a [post](https://www.facebook.com/groups/392935134763820/permalink/410672882990045/) and requested those with info or those who were present at that time of video being shot to come forward. The next day, the family received a call from Omdurman Morgue notifying them that the morgue has a body that resembles their son. On July/12th, the body of Zaki Magdi was identified and according to the family [statements](https://www.facebook.com/sotalsora2019/posts/473441806573049) , the autopsy revealed that he was shot in the head as the bullet shattered the skull, damaged the brain cells and left his body.

###Side Note:

It is unclear to the writing of this, that the reports from both Central Committee of Sudan Doctors (CCSD) and Sudan Doctors’ Syndicate that named a dead unidentified young man respectively, were indeed referring to the body of Zaki Magdi Zaki, as both reports were released before his body was found. No updates have been provided by both bodies as of the writing of this.

## Conclusion

After collecting and analysing visual documentation published on social media platforms and news networks, Sudan Archive determined that protesters in Omdurman were targeted with violence on June 30th 2019.

According to the analysed evidence and sources, protesters marched toward White Nile Bridge and were blocked by the security forces. The officers used force to disperse the protesters, resulting in 5 killed and more than 50 injured.
